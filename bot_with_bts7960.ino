/*  Arif 1703026, 23rd December, 2021
 *  This is a sample code for simple operation of a footbot driven by a pair of BTS7960 modules
 *  Necessary comments have been added for a better understanding
 *  One may need to alter/change their motor connection(s) for desired direction of rotation,
 *  Here it is assumed that right side motors are controlled by arduino pin 5 and 6
    and left side motors are controlled by arduino pin 9 and 10, these are PWM pins
 *  The bluetooth module is connected to arduino pin 0 and 1 for serial communication
